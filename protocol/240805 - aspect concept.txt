All big objects are realized with the Entity class. An Entity is an object without members. It consists only of its memory address. You can assign aspects to an Entity.

Fields are public not private, it there is no obvious benefit of privacy.

Maybe this is a violation of OOP-principles. The Entity class is more a data struct than a normal OOP-class.

These ideas are part of the aspect concept.

Further information for the aspect concept will be provided.

(The aspect concept is not the same as aspect-oriented programming.)
