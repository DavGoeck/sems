ES will be used to test itself.

The tests can be executed over the GUI.

This idea is partly inspired by the book 'Test-Driven Development' by Kent Beck. In this book the author develops a test framework which tests itself.

The advantages will be:
- ES-Logging can be used within the tests
- ES-GUI can be used to display the test results
- the tests become a feature of the software
- consistent architecture - also for the tests
- no external test-framework is required
