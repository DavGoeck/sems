What is a user-interface-specification? It specifies the interface for a human user. There is a fundamental difference between api-tests and ui-tests. An api-test can be automated. An ui-test cannot be automated (in general). The reason is, that - in principle - only a human being has the competence to say if a ui-specification is met. When you automate an ui-test, you probably cannot make it really independent to the implementation. Not all automated ui-tests are wrong - but probably they will never be as accurate as an automated api-test.
